	<p><b>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera.</b> <strong>It<br> 
has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of<br> 
its tail.</strong> <i>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.
</i> <em>With a typical head-to-<br>body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in).</em> <h6>It<br> 
is a social species,</h6> <h3>forming groups called prides.</h3> A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related<br> 
females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large<br> 
ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when<br> 
opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
