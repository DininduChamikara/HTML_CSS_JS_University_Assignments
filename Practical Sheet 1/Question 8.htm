			Cleopatra (69 BC – 10 August 30 BC) was queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and<br> 
its last active ruler. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder<br>
Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. After<br>
the death of Cleopatra, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end<br> 
of the second to last Hellenistic state and the age that had lasted since the reign of<br> 
Alexander (336–323 BC). Her native language was Koine Greek, and she was the only<br>
Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.
